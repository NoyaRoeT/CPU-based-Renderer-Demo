# CPU-based Renderer Demo

A project that I started to practice foundational graphics programming techniques.

Includes simple Rasterization using edge equations, backface culling, frustum culling, reverse Z-buffering, perspective correct interpolation of barycentric coordinates, texture mapping and some simple shaders.
