# CPU-based Renderer Demo

A project that I started to practice foundational graphics programming techniques.

Includes:
* Simple vector-matrix library
* Wireframe drawing with Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
* Rasterization using edge equations
* Texture mapping
* Backface Culling
* Frustum Culling
* Shader interface using C++ inheritance
* Simple shaders

Requires SDL2, which is not included in the repo.
